Bullet Hell Game

Welcome!!
We have 5 members in our group.  I prepose we each work on a piece of the game like was reccomended. As I see it, here are the pieces we will need:

1: player.  Used to keep track of players health, faceing, position, and velocity.

2: Bullet.  Used to make the bullets in the game.  Each bullet would need a location, velocity, size, and damage/special effects

3: Game.  Keeps track of score, game durration, level, etc.  Might also be the display of the game

4: Enemey.  Keeps track of enemy position/faceing, movement, and health

5: Controlls.  The Input/output for the user.  Works closely with player to move the player arround.

Additionaly, we will need to deside what kind of bullet-hell game we want to make.  In class we disccussed an "endless mode" style game that would basicly be a survival thing.
